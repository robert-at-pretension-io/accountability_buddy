# accountability_buddy
A simple ai that helps with keeping up with solutions to life's problems.

# Motivation
* We will be exploring "jamstack" which can be a number of different technologies. In order to learn about the most popular jamstack by time of writing, Next.js will be used. This is the most up-to-date list: https://jamstack.org/generators/ .

# Goals
* Learn about the different technologies used in the jamstack.

# Technologies Used
* ~~Next.js~~
* ~~React (latest as of this writing) V 18.0~~
* Sveltekit -- Easiest for "just plain html/js/css" simple websites
* ~~Storybook -- Shows the different components in the app~~ (Doesn't play well with sveltekit)
* Typescript
* Auth0 -- Add authentication to the app so paid subscriptions work.
* Temporal.io -- Used for scheduling checkin texts
* Openai -- Used for the AI that generates helpful solutions

# Tech stretch goals *After the basic app is working, I want to add the following features:*
* Twilio : Texting/email check-in reminders

# Need to know:
* How to create a private beta
